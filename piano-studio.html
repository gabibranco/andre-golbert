        About my Studio 
      </h4>
      <p>
        I am a professional, classically-trained pianist with a great passion for teaching. My mission as a pedagogue is to instill a love for music and for art in every student. 
        I offer in-home private lessons in the NYC area and online lessons globally.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I am happy to work with students of any level aged four and older. Whether you are a young beginner, an accomplished musician wishing to prepare for conservatoire auditions,  an adult beginner, or a lifelong music lover with a knack for piano performance, my studio is the right place for you!
      </p>
      <p> 
        As a Steinway Teacher and Educational Partner, I offer my students a number of educational opportunities, including the chance to perform at Steinway Hall for our studio recitals. 
      </p>
      <h4>
        One-on-one lessons
      </h4>
      <p>
        My lessons often go beyond piano technique and musical expression to explore additional topics of musicianship, music theory, history, and aesthetics.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Lessons last typically one hour, except for very young beginners, who can choose between 30 and 45-minute lessons.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Tuition
      </h4>
      <p>
        Tuition will be charged on a monthly basis according to the number of lessons scheduled.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Trial lessons
      </h4>
      <p>
        I offer free online consultations for anyone interested in starting lessons. Please don't hesitate to reach out and sign up <a href="https://calendly.com/andre-golbert" target="_blank">here</a>!
      </p>
      <h4>
        Cancellation Policy
      </h4>
      <p>
        I kindly ask that you send cancellation requests with a minimum of 24 hours in advance. If a cancellation is made less than 24 hours before the scheduled time, the lesson will be charged. Exceptions apply for serious and unforeseen circumstances. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Make-up lessons on alternative dates and times can be arranged as needed!
