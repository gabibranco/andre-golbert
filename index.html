        André Golbert, Piano
      </h3>
      <p>
        Recognized internationally as an emerging musical talent, Brazilian pianist André Golbert has given professional recitals in the United States, Europe and South America. He has been lauded by critics, renowned musicians and scholars for his “sublime melancholy balanced with impetuous energy,” “impeccable pianism… stunning musical poetry,” and for his “brilliant... electrifying” performances.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2015 Mr. Golbert was awarded a solo debut recital on the main stage of the prestigious Theatro São Pedro in Porto Alegre, Brazil. He has since given yearly professional recitals at this venue. In 2017, he also made his orchestral debut performing Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 2 with the Theatro São Pedro Chamber Orchestra, under conductor Antônio Carlos Borges-Cunha, in a concert celebrating the theater’s 159th Anniversary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Golbert has participated in several prestigious international summer music festivals, including the Aspen Music Festival and School as a student of Ann Schein, Rencontres Musicales à Lorraine in France, and Festival Música nas Montanhas in Brazil, and most recently, at Paul Roberts’s acclaimed Music at Chateau D’Aix festival in France. In 2019-2020, he joined the faculty of the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute in Tallahassee, Florida,where he taught lecture-recital courses including The Tantalizing Sounds and Images of Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel, and Beethoven and the Piano. His liner notes of Heidi Louise Williams’s solo album, Beyond the Sound, were published in 2019 by Albany Records and garnered outstanding reviews. Mr. Golbert’s recent engagements include a radio broadcast performance at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, a recital-conversation titled Music to Put Out Fires, featuring the piano music of Claude Debussy and dedicated to the memory of Brazil’s National Museum, held in Porto Alegre’s Theatro São Pedro, the performance of an all-Debussy program at the Cathédrale Saint-Croix de Paris des Arméniens, in Paris, and the defense of his doctoral treatise, Instant and Eternity: Vladimir Jankélévitch and the Piano Music of Claude Debussy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The recipient of many awards and scholarships, Mr. Golbert earned his Doctorate in Piano Performance at the nationally distinguished Florida State University College of Music, where he completed his studies with Heidi Louise Williams. He received his Master’s Performance degree at the Mannes School of Music in New York City under the tutelage of Arkady Aronov, and completed his Bachelor of Music Performance degree at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul – Institute of the Arts, a premier music conservatory in Brazil, where he studied with Ney Fialkow. In 2021 he will join the renowned Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where he has been accepted to the highly prestigious Artist Diploma program as a student of Paul Roberts.

        Of the many students I have guided in their academic graduate work over three decades, I have not encountered another whose thought is as nuanced, whose range of reference is as broad, whose curiosity is as insatiable, and whose musicality is as refined as Mr. Golbert’s.

        André Golbert emerges as a new young Brazilian talent of the piano…his performance balanced sublime melancholy
        with impetuous energy, as if romantic fluidity had encountered flashes of inspired spontaneity in a single
        stream of sensitivity.</p>
