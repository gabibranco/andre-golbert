          André Golbert, Piano
        </h3>
        <p>
          Recognized internationally as an emerging young musical talent, Brazilian pianist André Golbert has given professional recitals in the United States, Europe and South America. He has been lauded by critics, renowned musicians and scholars for his "sublime melancholy balanced with impetuous energy," "impeccable pianism and stunning musical poetry," and for his "brilliant, (…) electrifying" performances.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2015 Mr. Golbert was awarded a solo debut recital on the main stage of the prestigious Theatro São Pedro in Porto Alegre.  He has since given yearly professional recitals at this venue, and in 2017 he also made his orchestral debut performing Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 2 with the Theatro São Pedro Chamber Orchestra.  The recipient of many awards and scholarships, Mr. Golbert is currently a Doctoral Candidate in Piano Performance at the nationally distinguished Florida State University College of Music, where he studies with Heidi Louise Williams. He completed his Master’s Performance degree at the Mannes School of Music in New York City under the tutelage of Arkady Aronov, and completed his Bachelor of Music Performance degree at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul – Institute of the Arts, a premier music conservatory in Brazil, where he studied with Ney Fialkow.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mr. Golbert has participated in several prestigious international summer music festivals, including the Aspen Music Festival as a student of Ann Schein, Rencontres Musicales à Lorraine in France and Festival Música nas Montanhas in Brazil, and most recently, at Paul Roberts’ acclaimed Music at Chateau d’Aix festival in France. He is on the faculty of the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute in Tallahassee, Florida, where he teaches lecture-recital courses including The Tantalizing Sounds and Images of Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel and Beethoven and the Piano.  He authored the liner notes, recently published by Albany Records, of Heidi Louise Williams’s newest solo album, Beyond the Sound. Recent engagements include a radio broadcast performance at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, a recital-conversation titled Music to Put Out Fires, dedicated to the memory of Brazil’s National Museum, held in Porto Alegre’s Theatro São Pedro, and an all-Debussy recital, held at the Cathédrale Saint-Croix-Saint-Jean-des-Arméniens, in Paris.

          André Golbert emerges as a new young Brazilian talent of the piano…his performance balanced sublime melancholy with impetuous energy, as if romantic fluidity had encountered flashes of inspired spontaneity in a single stream of sensitivity.</p>
